A standard interface for Non-Fungible Key Bound Tokens, also known as a Non-Fungible **KBT**[^1].

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts and provides basic functionality to the `addBinding`[^2] function. This function creates **Key Wallets**[^3], which are used to `allowTransfer`[^4] or `allowApproval`[^5] in order to conduct a **Safe Transfer**[^6] of non-fungible tokens. In the process, the tokens are also safely approved so they can be spent by the user or another on-chain third-party entity.

This functionality is fully optional and security features malleable to suit one's needs. To activate it, the holder must add 2 different wallets when emitting the `addBinding`[^2] function. These will be known as `_keyWallet1`[^7] and `_keyWallet2`[^8]. If the user does not activate the assets security feature, **KBTs**[^1] **Default Behavior**[^22] is the same as a traditional non-fungible [_ERC-721_](../EIPS/eip-721.md) token. However, even when the security feature is activated, the standard has **Default Values**[^23] which the user can input to achieve the same result.

We considered **KBTs**[^1] being used by every individual who wishes to add additional security to their non-fungible assets, as well as consignment to third-party wallets/brokers/banks/insurers/museums. **KBTs**[^1] allow tokens to be more resilient to attacks/thefts, by providing additional protection to the asset itself on a self-custodial level.

## Motivation

The creation of blockchain technology brought with it the idea of decentralized self-custodial assets, and the possibility of financial transactions taking place without relying on banks, governments, or other third-party entities. It presented new possibilities and benefits for humanity, constructing what some would consider a new financial sector over the years. From possibilities emerged opportunities, and where there’s opportunity, there is almost always a bad actor waiting to seize it.

In this fast-paced technologically advancing world, people learn and mature at different speeds. The goal of global adoption must take into consideration the target demographic is of all ages and backgrounds. Unfortunately for self-custodial assets, one of the greatest pros is also one of its greatest cons. The individual is solely responsible for their actions and adequately securing their assets. If a mistake is made leading to a loss of funds, no one is able to guarantee their return.

In 2021, the _FTC_[^23] in the United States received more than 46,000 filed reports of crypto theft valued at over $1 Billion[^19]. Theft and malicious scams are an issue in any financial sector and oftentimes lead to stricter regulation. However, government-imposed regulation goes against one of its core values of crypto. Efforts have been made to increase security within the space both through centralized and decentralized means. Up until now, no one has offered a solution that holds onto the advantages of both whilst eliminating their disadvantages.

Centralized solutions are low-cost and scalable, but as the saying goes "Not your keys, Not your crypto". In November 2022, this was perfectly displayed with the collapse of the second-largest crypto exchange at the time, FTX[^20]. As the company went bankrupt, it exposed an $8 billion void in its user's accounts[^21] devastating the international crypto space. When a third-party entity has access to your funds, the asset is no longer self-custodial and is at risk. It doesn’t matter if it’s a start-up or a multi-billion dollar operation, the safest place for your assets is in your custody. This is one of the factors that led to the creation of crypto to begin with. Why should someone bare the cost due to the fault and mismanagement of others?

There are also decentralized solutions, the most popular being expensive hardware wallets. Their main advantage is they are decentralized, self-custodial and transparent on the blockchain. The first shortcoming is their cost, which is simply not viable for a global demographic. This is especially true for _NICs_[^25] and _LEDCs_[^26]. In addition to the cost, secure shipping logistics and a trusted vendor is required. Once again making it difficult for a larger demographic to obtain them. A carbon footprint is also produced in both the creation and shipping of hardware wallets. This is counteractive to Ethereum's ‘green blockchain’ push by when it migrated from _PoW_[^27] to _PoS_[^28] protocol. Lastly, the majority of hardware wallets have a single point of failure, that being the seed phrase or private key. Obtaining one of these is a crucial step in the overtly common phishing attacks targeted at self-custodial users.

The team behind the Key Bound Token Standard first set out to create a new security solution after repeatedly hearing devastating stories as a direct result of theft, theft that not only affected strangers but friends and family alike. All of the pros and cons mentioned above, as well as other criteria, were taken into extensive consideration by the team.

We asked ourselves the same question as many have in the past, “How does one protect the wallet?”. After a while, realizing the question that should be asked is “How does one protect the asset?”. Creating the wallet is free, the asset is what has value and is worth protecting. This question led to the development of **KBTs**[^1]. A solution that is fully optional and can be tailored so far as the user is concerned. Individual assets remain protected even if the seed phrase or private key is publicly released, as long as the security feature was activated.

Non-Fungible **KBTs**[^1] saw the need to improve on the widely used non-fungible _ERC-721_[^9] token standard. The security of non-fungible assets is a topic that concerns every entity in the crypto space, as their current and future use cases continue to be explored. **KBTs**[^1] provide a scalable decentralized security solution that takes security one step beyond wallet security e.g. _BIP-39_[^10], focusing exclusively on the token's ability to remain secure. The security is on the blockchain itself, which allows every demographic that has access to the internet to secure their assets without the need for current hardware or centralized solutions.

During the development process, the potential advantages **KBTs**[^1] explored were the main motivation factors leading to their creation;

1. They are fully decentralized on the blockchain.

2. Scalability outside adoption is not an issue. Anyone with access to the internet can use and activate the security features.

3. There is no additional carbon footprint produced when using Key Bound Tokens, making it an eco-friendly way to protect digital assets.

4. Security features are optional, customizable and removable. They can have the same **Default Behaviours**[^22] of a traditional _ERC-721_[^9] token. In addition, a set of **Default Values**[^23] can also be used to achieve the same result.

5. Even if a wallet is compromised, non-fungible assets following the Key Bound Token standard will remain secure, so long as the security feature is activated.

6. The security feature can be activated by a simple call to the `addBinding`[^2] function. The user will only need two other wallets, which will act as `_keyWallet1`[^7] and `_keyWallet2`[^8] to gain the full benefits of the standard.

7. Once the security feature is activated, it automatically protects the asset. The asset can be unlocked via the `allowTransfer`[^4] or `allowApproval`[^5] function requiring a signature from either `_keyWallet1`[^7] or `_keyWallet2`[^8].

8. If the owner suspects that the **Holding Wallet**[^11] has been compromised or lost access, they can call the `safeFallback`[^12] function from one of the **Key Wallets**[^3]. This moves the assets to the other **Key Wallet**[^3] preventing a single point of failure.

9. If the owner suspects that one of the **Key Wallets**[^3] has been comprised or lost access, the owner can call the `resetBindings`[^13] function from `_keyWallet1`[^7] or `_keyWallet2`[^8]. This resets the **KBTs**[^1] security feature and allows the **Holding Wallet**[^11] to call the `addBinding`[^2] function again. New **Key Wallets**[^3] can therefore be added and a single point of failure can be prevented.

**NOTES**:

- The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.8.17` (or above)
- Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`. Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!

---

### **Interface functions**

The functions detailed below MUST be implemented.

#### `addBindings` function

Secures the sender account with other two wallets called `_keyWallet1` and `_keyWallet2` and MUST fire the `AccountSecured` event.

The function SHOULD `throw` if:

- the sender account is not a holder
- or the sender is already secured
- or the keyWallets are the same
- or one of the keyWallets is the same as the sender
- or one or both keyWallets are zero address (`0x0`)
- or one or both keyWallets are already keyWallets to another holder account

```solidity
function addBindings (address _keyWallet1, address _keyWallet2) external returns (bool)
```

#### `getBindings` function

The function returns the `keyWallets` for the `_account` in a `struct` format.

```solidity
struct AccountHolderBindings {
    address firstWallet;
    address secondWallet;
}
```

```solidity
function getBindings(address _account) external view returns (AccountHolderBindings memory)
```

#### `resetBindings` function

**Note:** This function is helpful when one of the two `keyWallets` is compromised.

Called from a `keyWallet`, the function resets the `keyWallets` for the `holder` account. MUST fire the `AccountResetBinding` event.

The function SHOULD `throw` if the sender is not a `keyWallet`.

```solidity
function resetBindings() external returns (bool)
```

#### `safeFallback` function

**Note:** This function is helpful when the `holder` account is compromised.

Called from a `keyWallet`, this function transfers all the tokens from the `holder` account to the other `keyWallet` and MUST fire the `SafeFallbackActivated` event.

The function SHOULD `throw` if the sender is not a `keyWallet`.

```solidity
function safeFallback() external returns (bool);
```

#### `allowTransfer` function

Called from a `keyWallet`, this function is called before a `transferFrom` or `safeTransferFrom` functions are called.

It allows to transfer a tokenId, for a specific time frame, to a specific address.

If the tokenId is 0 then there will be no restriction on the tokenId.
If the time is 0 then there will be no restriction on the time.
If the to address is zero address then there will be no restriction on the to address.
Or if `_anyToken` is `true`, regardless of the other params, it allows any token, whenever, to anyone to be transferred of the holder.

The function MUST fire `AccountEnabledTransfer` event.

The function SHOULD `throw` if the sender is not a `keyWallet` for a holder or if the owner of the `_tokenId` is different than the `holder`.

```solidity
function allowTransfer(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _time, address _to, bool _anyToken) external returns (bool);
```

#### `getTransferableFunds` function

The function returns the transfer conditions for the `_account` in a `struct` format.

```solidity
struct TransferConditions {
    uint256 tokenId;
    uint256 time;
    address to;
    bool anyToken;
}
```

```solidity
function getTransferableFunds(address _account) external view returns (TransferConditions memory);
```

#### `allowApproval` function

Called from a `keyWallet`, this function is called before `approve` or `setApprovalForAll` functions are called.

It allows the `holder` for a specific amount of `_time` to do an `approve` or `setApprovalForAll` and limit the number of transfers the spender is allowed to do through `_numberOfTransfers` (0 - unlimited number of transfers in the allowance limit).

The function MUST fire `AccountEnabledApproval` event.

The function SHOULD `throw` if the sender is not a `keyWallet`.

```solidity
function allowApproval(uint256 _time) external returns (bool)
```

#### `getApprovalConditions` function

The function returns the approval conditions in a struct format. Where `time` is the `block.timestamp` until the `approve` or `setApprovalForAll` functions can be called, and `numberOfTransfers` is the number of transfers the spender will be allowed.

```solidity
struct ApprovalConditions {
    uint256 time;
    uint256 numberOfTransfers;
}
```

```solidity
function getApprovalConditions(address _account) external view returns (ApprovalConditions memory);
```

#### `transferFrom` function

The function transfers from `_from` address to `_to` address the `_tokenId` token.

Each time a spender calls the function the contract subtracts and checks if the number of allowed transfers of that spender has reached 0,
and when that happens, the approval is revoked using a set approval for all to `false`.

The function MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The function SHOULD `throw` if:

- the sender is not the owner or is not approved to transfer the `_tokenId`
- or if the `_from` address is not the owner of the `_tokenId`
- or if the sender is a secure account and it has not allowed for transfer this `_tokenId` through `allowTransfer` function.

```solidity
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external returns (bool)
```

#### `safeTransferFrom` function

The function transfers from `_from` address to `_to` address the `_tokenId` token.

The function MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The function SHOULD `throw` if:

- the sender is not the owner or is not approved to transfer the `_tokenId`
- or if the `_from` address is not the owner of the `_tokenId`
- or if the sender is a secure account and it has not allowed for transfer this `_tokenId` through `allowTransfer` function.

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes memory data) external returns (bool)
```

#### `safeTransferFrom` function, with data parameter

This works identically to the other function with an extra data parameter, except this function just sets data to "".

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external returns (bool)
```

#### `approve` function

The function allows `_to` account to transfer the `_tokenId` from the sender account.

The function also limits the `_to` account to the specific number of transfers set in the `ApprovalConditions` for that `holder` account. If the value is `0` then the `_spender` can transfer multiple times.

The function MUST fire an `Approval` event.

If the function is called again it overrides the number of transfers allowed with `_numberOfTransfers`, set in `allowApproval` function.

The function SHOULD `throw` if:

- the sender is not the current NFT owner, or an authorized operator of the current owner
- the NFT owner is secured and has not called `allowApproval` function
- or if the `_time`, set in the `allowApproval` function, has elapsed.

```solidity
function approve(address _to, uint256 _tokenId) public virtual override(ERC721, IERC721)
```

#### `setApprovalForAll` function

The function enables or disables approval for another account `_operator` to manage all of sender assets.

The function also limits the `_to` account to the specific number of transfers set in the `ApprovalConditions` for that `holder` account. If the value is `0` then the `_spender` can transfer multiple times.

The function Emits an `Approval` event indicating the updated allowance.

If the function is called again it overrides the number of transfers allowed with `_numberOfTransfers`, set in `allowApproval` function.

The function SHOULD `throw` if:

- the sender account is secured and has not called `allowApproval` function
- or if the `_spender` is a zero address (`0x0`)
- or if the `_time`, set in the `allowApproval` function, has elapsed.

```solidity
function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public virtual override(ERC721, IERC721)
```

---

### **Internal functions**

#### `_hasAllowedTransfer` function

The function returns `true` if:

- the `_account` has allowed for transfer any token through `_anyToken` parameter
- or the `_account` has allowed for transfer a `_tokenId`, for `_to` address and if the `time` has not elapsed

In all other cases the function will return `false`.

```solidity
function _hasAllowedTransfer(
        address _account,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        address _to
    ) internal view returns (bool) {
        TransferConditions memory conditions = _transferConditions[_account];

        if (conditions.anyToken) {
            return true;
        }

        if (
            (conditions.tokenId == 0 &&
                conditions.time == 0 &&
                conditions.to == address(0)) ||
            (conditions.tokenId > 0 && conditions.tokenId != _tokenId) ||
            (conditions.time > 0 && conditions.time < block.timestamp) ||
            (conditions.to != address(0) && conditions.to != _to)
        ) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
```

#### `_getAccountHolder` function

This function identifies and returns the `_holder` account starting from the `sender` address.

If the `sender` is not a `keyWallet` zero address is returned (`0x0`).

```solidity
function _getAccountHolder() internal view returns (address) {
    address sender = _msgSender();
    return
        _firstAccounts[sender].accountHolderWallet != address(0)
            ? _firstAccounts[sender].accountHolderWallet
            : (
                _secondAccounts[sender].accountHolderWallet != address(0)
                    ? _secondAccounts[sender].accountHolderWallet
                    : address(0)
            );
}
```

#### `_getOtherSecureWallet` function

This function identifies and returns the other `keyWallet` starting from the `sender` address.

If the `sender` is not a `keyWallet` zero address is returned (`0x0`).

```solidity
function _getOtherSecureWallet() internal view returns (address) {
    address sender = _msgSender();
    address accountHolder = _getAccountHolder();

    return
        _holderAccounts[accountHolder].firstWallet == sender
            ? _holderAccounts[accountHolder].secondWallet
            : _holderAccounts[accountHolder].firstWallet;
}
```

#### `_isApprovalAllowed` function

This function returns `true` if the `_time`, set in `allowApproval` function, has not elapsed yet.

```solidity
function _isApprovalAllowed(address account) internal view returns (bool) {
    return _allowApproval[account] >= block.timestamp;
}
```

#### `_afterTokenTransfer` function

This function is called after a successful `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `mint` and `burn`.

This function fires `Egress` event when loosing a holder and `Ingress` event when gaining a holder.

```solidity
function _afterTokenTransfer(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _firstTokenId,
    uint256 _batchSize
) internal virtual override {
    if (_from != address(0)) {
        // region update secureAccounts
        if (isSecureWallet(_from) && balanceOf(_from) == 0) {
            delete _firstAccounts[_holderAccounts[_from].firstWallet];
            delete _secondAccounts[_holderAccounts[_from].secondWallet];
            delete _holderAccounts[_from];
        }
        // endregion
        if (balanceOf(_from) == 0) {
            emit Egress(_from, _firstTokenId);
        }
    }

    if (_to != address(0) && balanceOf(_to) == _batchSize) {
        emit Ingress(_to, _firstTokenId);
    }
}
```

## Rationale

Non-Fungible Key Bound Tokens were made as an alternative to current crypto security solutions. They inherit all of the _ERC-721_[^9] characteristics so current DApps would accept the use of **KBTs**[^1] flawlessly on all current platforms. However, non-fungible **KBTs**[^1] provide a number of benefits over the existing _ERC-721_[^9] token standard. Each design decision was purposefully made for customizable self-custodial asset security. Security created to be accessible, applicable, and decentrally scalable.

Non-Fungible **KBTs**[^1] were designed to be;

Fully Optional: If the user would like to use the non-fungible **KBTs**^[1] as a traditional _ERC-721_[^9], the security feature does not have to be activated. As the token inherits all of the same characteristics, it results in the token acting with traditional non-fungible **Default Behaviours**[^22]. However, even when the security features are activated, the user will still have the ability to customize the functionality of the various features based on their desired outcome. The user can pass a set of custom and or **Default Values**[^23] manually or through a DApp.

Completely Decentralized: The security features are fully decentralized meaning no third-party will have access to user funds when activated. This was done in order to truly stay in line with the premise of self-custodial assets, responsibility and values.

Limitless Scalability: Centralized solutions require the creation of an account and their availability may be restricted based on location. **KBTs**[^1] do not face regional restrictions or account creation. Decentralized security solutions such as hardware options face scalability issues requiring transport logistics, secure shipping, and vendor. **KBTs**[^1] can be used anywhere around the world by anyone who so wishes, provided they have access to the internet.

Undeniable Anonymity: Frequently, centralized solutions ask for personal information that is stored and subject to prying eyes. Purchasing decentralized hardware solutions are susceptible to the same issues e.g. a shipping address, payment information or a camera recording during a physical cash pick-up. This may be considered by some as infringing on their privacy and asset anonymity. **KBTs**[^1] ensures user confidentially as everything can be done remotely under a pseudonym on the blockchain.

Environmentally Friendly: Since the security features are coded into the standard, there is no need for centralized servers, shipping, or the production of physical object/s. Thus leading to a minimal carbon footprint by the use of **KBTs**[^1], working hand in hand with Ethereum’s change to a _PoS_[^28] network.

Low-Cost Security: The cost of using **KBTs**[^1] security features correlate to on-chain fees, the current **GWEI**[^17] at the given time. As a standalone solution, they are a viable cost-effective security measure feasible to the majority of the population.

Unmatched Security: By calling the `addBinding`[^2] function a **Key Wallet**[^3] is now required for the `allowTransfer`[^4] or `allowApproval`[^5] function. The `allowTransfer`[^4] function requires 4 parameters, `_amount`[^14], `_time`[^15], `_address`[^16], and `_allFunds`[^29], where as the `allowApproval`[^5] function there are 2 parameters, `_time`[^30] and `_numberOfTransfers`[^31]. In addition to this, **KBTs[^1]** have a `safeFallback`[^12] and `resetBindings`[^13] function. The combination of all these prevent and virtually cover every single point of failure that is present with a traditional _ERC-721_[^9], when properly used.

Increased Confidence: With **KBTs**[^1], holders can be confident that their tokens are safe and secure, even if the **Holding Wallet**[^11] or one of the **Key Wallets**[^3] has been compromised.

User Experience: **KBTs**[^1] optional security features improve the overall user experience and Ethereum ecosystem by ensuring a safety net for those who decide to use it. Those that do not use the security features are not hindered in any way. This safety net can increase global adoption as people can remain confident in the security of their assets, even in the scenario of a compromised wallet.

_Note_: The latest developments, information, and tests for the standard can be found at the official kbtstandard.org website.

## Backwards Compatibility

Key Bound Tokens are designed to be backward-compatible with existing token standards and wallets. Existing tokens and wallets will continue to function as normal, and will not be affected by the implementation of **KBTs**[^1].

## Test Cases

The [KBTstandard repository](../assets/eip-6809/README.md) has all the [tests](../assets/eip-6809/test/kbt721.js).

Average Gas used (_GWEI_[^17] ):

- `addBindings` - 155,096
- `resetBindings` - 30,588
- `safeFallback` - 72,221 (depending on how many NFTs the holder has)
- `allowTransfer` - 50,025
- `allowApproval` - 44,983

## Reference Implementation

The GitHub repository [KBTstandard repository](../assets/eip-6809/README.md) contains the implementation. There's also a [diagram](../assets/eip-6809/Contract%20interactions%20diagram.png) with the contract interactions.

## Security Considerations

Non-Fungible Key Bound Tokens were designed with security in mind every step of the way. Below are some design decisions that were rigorously discussed and thought through during the development process.

**Key Wallets**[^3]: These have been limited to two, in order to prevent a pitfall scenario of a user adding multiple wallets. For this reason, we have stuck to _BIP-39_[^9] split across three wallets as opposed to creating a _SLIP-39_[^18] security solution. Thus we can prevent a disastrous `safeFallback`[^12] scenario.

Typically if a wallet is compromised, the digital assets within are at risk. With Non-Fungible Key Bound Tokens there are two different functions that can be called from a **Key Wallet**[^3] depending on which wallet has been compromised.

Scenario: **Holding Wallet**[^11] has been compromised, call `safeFallback`[^12].

`safeFallback`[^12]: This function was created in the event that the owner believes the **Holding Wallet**[^11] has been compromised. It can also be used if the owner losses access to the **Holding Wallet**[^11]. In this scenario, the user has the ability to call `safeFallback`[^12] from one of the **Key Wallets**[^3]. Funds are then redirected from the **Holding Wallet**[^11] to the other **Key Wallet**[^3].

By redirecting the funds it prevents a single point of failure. If an attacker were to call `safeFallback`[^12] and the funds redirected to the **Key Wallet**[^3] that called the function, they would gain access to all the funds.

Scenario: **Key Wallet**[^3] has been compromised, call `resetBindings`[^13].

`resetBindings`[^13]: This function was created in the event that the owner believes `keyWallet1`[^7] or `keyWallet2`[^8] has been compromised. It can also be used if the owner losses access to one of the **Key Wallets**[^3]. In this instance, the user has the ability to call `resetBindings`[^13], removing the bound **Key Wallets**[^3] and resetting the security features. The digital asset will now function as a traditional _ERC-721_[^9] until `addBindings`[^2] is called again and a new set of **Key Wallets**[^3] are added.

The reason why `keyWallet1`[^7] or `keyWallet2`[^8] are required to call the `resetBindings`[^13] function is because a **Holding Wallet**[^11] having the ability to call `resetBindings`[^13] could result in an immediate loss of funds. The attacker would only need to gain access to the **Holding Wallet**[^11] and call `resetBindings`[^13].

In the scenario that 2 of the 3 wallets have been compromised, there is nothing the owner of the **KBTs**[^1] can do if the attack is malicious. However, by allowing 1 wallet to be compromised, Key Bound Token holders are given a second chance, unlike other token standards.

The `allowTransfer`[^4] function is in place to guarantee a **Safe Transfer**[^6], but can also have **Default Values**[^22] set by a DApp to emulate **Default Bahviours**[^23] of a traditional _ERC-721_[^9]. It enables the user to highly specify the type of transfer they are about to conduct, whilst simultaneously allowing the user to unlock all funds to anyone for an unlimited amount of time. The desired security is completely up to the user.

This function requires 4 parameters to be filled and different combinations of these result in different levels of security;

Parameter 1 `_tokenId`[^14]: This is the ID of the token that will be spent on a transfer.

Parameter 2 `_time`[^15]: The number of blocks the token can be transferred starting from the current block timestamp.

Parameter 3 `_address`[^16]: The destination the token will be sent to.

Parameter 4 `_allFunds`[^29]: This is a boolean value. When false, the `transfer` function takes into consideration Parameters 1, 2 and 3. If the value is true, the `transfer` function will revert to a **Default Behaviour**[^22], the same as a traditional _ERC-721_[^9].

The `allowTransfer`[^4] function requires a **Key Wallet**[^2] and enables the **Holding Wallet**[^11] to conduct the transaction within the previously specified parameters. These parameters were added in order to provide additional security by limiting the **Holding Wallet**[^11] in the case it was compromised without the user's knowledge.

The `allowApproval`[^5] function provides extra security when allowing on-chain third parties to use your non-fungible **KBTs**[^1] on your behalf. This is especially useful when a user is met with common malicious attacks e.g. draining DApp.

This function requires 2 parameters to be filled and different combinations of these result in different levels of security;

Parameter 1 `_time`[^30]: The number of blocks that the approval of a third-party service can take place, starting from the current block timestamp.

Parameter 2 `_numberOfTransfers_`[^31]: The number of transactions a third-party service can conduct on the user's behalf.

The `allowApproval`[^5] function requires a **Key Wallet**[^2] which enables the **Holding Wallet**[^11] to allow a third-party service by using the `approve` function. These parameters were added to provide extra security when granting permission to a third-party that uses assets on the user's behalf. Parameter 1, `_time`[^30], is a limitation to when the **Holding Wallet**[^11] can `approve` a third-party service. Parameter 2 ,`_numberOfTranfers`[^31], is a limitation to the number of transactions the approved third-party service can conduct on the user's behalf before revoking approval.
